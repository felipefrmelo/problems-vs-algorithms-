##  Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

The solution uses a linear search. It examines each number in a given list, and determines whether it's larger than the "max_number", or smaller than the "min_number".

### Efficiency

- Time complexity :
  - The time efficiency of the solution is O(n)

- The space efficiency O(1) 
  - The list is traversed in-place, so the space efficiency is O(1).
