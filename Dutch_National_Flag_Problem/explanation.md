## Dutch National Flag Problem

Maintain 3 indexes to keep track of the last index of next_pos_0 (0), front_index (1), and  next_pos_2 (2) values

Traverse the array and depends on the value front_index, perform swapping of values and update the corresponding index accordingly.



### Efficiency

- Time complexity  O(n)):
  - The logic completes in a single traversal
- The space efficiency O(1) 
  - No temporary data structures are used in order to arrive at the solution.
